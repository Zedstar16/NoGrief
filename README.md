# NoGrief
Simple plugin to prevent accidental griefing by ops

Command: /nogrief
You can toggle mode to allow or disallow block placing and breaking.
permission to use the command is nogrief
By default only ops have access to it

# Why?
i made it because it regularly accidentally break things while pvping etc on my server xd
i'm sure other people do it as well so i decided to make a small plugin to prevent it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
